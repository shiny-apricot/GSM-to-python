Feature Scoring Module 🎯

Purpose:
    Calculate performance metrics and importance scores for individual features
    in gene expression data.

Key Functions:
    - score_features: Evaluate individual features using ML metrics
    - calculate_feature_importance: Extract feature importance from trained models

Example:
    >>> scores = score_features(X_train, y_train, feature_names, logger)
    >>> importance = calculate_feature_importance(model, feature_names)
